# Incident follow up

We wrapped the first beta of the access control module. The release notes highlight the backlog for log rotation and audit export. Support documented how each fix answers the customer tickets.

Next steps:
- run load tests on Monday
- circulate the ops checklist to the on-call team

The project commit log lists owners for every action. That keeps review conversations grounded in specific work instead of broad claims.
